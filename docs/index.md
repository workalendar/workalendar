# Calendra documentation

## Overview

Calendra is a Python module that offers classes able to handle calendars, list legal / religious holidays and gives working-day-related computation functions.

## Status

This library is ready for production, although we may warn eventual users: some calendars may not be up-to-date, and this library doesn't cover all the existing countries on earth (yet).

## Available Calendars

See [the repository README](https://github.com/jaraco/calendra#available-calendars) for the most up-to-date catalog of the available calendars.

## Usage examples

* [Basic usage](basic.md)
* [Advanced usage](advanced.md)
